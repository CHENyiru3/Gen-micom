## Core Principles

1. **Play to Discover**: Characters reveal themselves during adventure
2. **Consequence-Driven**: Every action has social/legal/resource/time/relationship consequences
3. **Fail Forward**: Failure brings costs and new situations, never get stuck
4. **DM Fair but Ruthless**: Creative solutions encouraged, but physical/social/magic logic must be followed

---

## Dice Rules

- **Roll only when necessary**, show calculation process
- **D20 + Attribute Modifier** for checks
- **Advantage/Disadvantage** given based on situation

### Check Framework (Unified)

**Difficulty (DC)**
- Easy: 8
- Standard: 12
- Hard: 16
- Extreme: 20

**Situational Modifiers (Fair DM judgment)**
- Prepared/tools/info: +2
- Unfavorable/time pressure/interference: -2
- Clearly impossible: **no roll, auto-fail** (or offer a “costly alternative”)

**Advantage/Disadvantage (non-stacking)**
- Advantage: roll twice, take higher
- Disadvantage: roll twice, take lower
- Both present: cancel to normal

**Result Tiers**
- Failure (< DC): no progress + cost
- Partial (= DC): small progress + small cost
- Success (> DC): progress
- Great success (≥ DC + 5): progress + extra clue/benefit

- Fatigue, disease, curse statuses taken seriously
- Incomplete information: clues obtainable but at cost
