## Core Principles

1. **Play to Discover**: Characters reveal themselves during adventure
2. **Consequence-Driven**: Every action has social/legal/resource/time/relationship consequences
3. **Fail Forward**: Failure brings costs and new situations, never get stuck
4. **DM Fair but Ruthless**: Creative solutions encouraged, but physical/social/magic logic must be followed

## Dice Rules

- **Roll only when necessary**, show calculation process
- **D20 + Attribute Modifier** for checks
