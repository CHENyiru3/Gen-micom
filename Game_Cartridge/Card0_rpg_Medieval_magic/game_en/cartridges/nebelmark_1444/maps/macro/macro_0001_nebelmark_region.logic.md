# Logic — macro_0001_nebelmark_region Nebelmark Region Map

## 1) Design Constraints (Hard Constraints)
- Macro nodes and faction boundaries must not conflict with `lore/CANON/WORLD.md`, `lore/CANON/FACTIONS.md`.
- Must support PI/RP and mist activity zone annotations.

## 2) Derivation Chain (Key Causality)
- To be added: Transportation nodes (cities, castles, monasteries, checkpoints, bridges, markets) and road network.

## 3) Uncertainty and Fog Strategy
- Unexplored areas by players remain `?`; only reveal after session events trigger or intelligence sources confirm.

## 4) Update Log (must write reason)

### v0.1.0
- reason: Initialize placeholder and three-piece set landing
- sources: [lore/CANON/WORLD.md, lore/CANON/FACTIONS.md]
