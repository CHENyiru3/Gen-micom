# Logic — micro_0001_nebelheim_city Nebelheim City Map

## 1) Design Constraints (Hard Constraints)
- City districts must match six districts in `lore/MIST/LAESURAE.md` (outer shantytown, guild street, market/tavern, Jewish quarter, cathedral district, executioner's bridge and city edge).
- Unexplored areas must not show internal details; rumored POIs don't draw structure, only mark points.

## 2) Derivation Chain (Key Causality)
- To be added: Triple city defenses and node topology (gate → main street → market/cathedral/city hall control chain).

## 3) Uncertainty and Fog Strategy
- Alleyways, sewer exits, secret passages: default `?`, using "sighted/surveyed/traded intelligence" as reveal reason.

## 4) Update Log (must write reason)

### v0.1.0
- reason: Initialize placeholder and three-piece set landing
- sources: [lore/MIST/LAESURAE.md]
