## 0. Quick Anchors

- **Mist Border (Nebelmark)**: Fictional border on the left bank of the upper Rhine
- **Nebelheim**: Free Imperial City, main stage
- **Era**: 1444 (Crack Phase) → 1445/46 (Threshold Crossing)
- **System**: D&D 5e (grounded medieval realism)

---

## 1. Design Pillars

1. **Daytime history cannot be overturned**: Politics, war, economics, classes, law follow real-world logic
2. **Fantasy appears as "seepage"**: Rumors and individual cases first, then repeatable weirdness
3. **Divine punishment and redemption coexist**: The supernatural is not a reward, but a trial
4. **Consequences drive the narrative**: Every success/failure changes world state

---

## 2. Era Background (1444)

### 2.1 European Landscape

This is the cusp of "Autumn of the Middle Ages" and "Spring of the Renaissance":

- **Church**: Great Schism formally healed, but authority is fragile. Council of Basel (1431-1449) fights Pope for supremacy
- **France**: Hundred Years' War nearly over (ends 1453), royal power revives, projecting eastward
- **Holy Roman Empire**: Nominally vast, actual power fragmented. Emperor far in hereditary lands, border cities left to fend for themselves
- **Burgundy**: Rich, refined, orderly, ambitious—temptation to cities more dangerous than armies

### 2.2 Technology and Society

- Gunpowder and phalanxes erode knightly military monopoly
- Currency and taxation冲击 lordly land rents
- Guilds and burgher class rise, social mobility accelerates
- Violence and opportunity coexist

## 3. Geography: The Mist Border

### 3.1 Key Terrain

| Area | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Rhine River Mainline** | Trade and military spine, refugee corridor |
| **Black Pine Forest and Mist Marsh** | Heaviest mist region, legend says "Wild Hunt" once passed through |
| **Hill Vineyards** | Wealthiest guilds and Burgundy merchants influence here most |
| **Mines and Quarries** | Economic lifeline, earliest sites of "underground anomalies" |

### 3.2 Transportation and Nodes

- **Market routes**: Determine city survival; when blocked, famine is the first card played
- **Border checkpoints and bridge tolls**: Guilds and nobles, bishoprics fight for tax rights
- **Secret paths**: "Underground road network" used by heretics, smugglers, vagrants

---

## 4. Nebelheim

### 4.1 City Structure (Outer to Inner)

1. **Outer earthworks and refugee shantytowns**: Hatchery for hunger, disease, rumors
2. **Middle residential areas and guild towers**: Workshops, taverns, markets, political factions ferment
3. **Old Town and Cathedral District**: Nobility and high clergy power stage

### 4.2 Key Locations

| Location | Function | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| City Hall and Cellars | Deals, bribes, intrigue, faction trading | Faction warfare |
| Jewish Quarter | Medicine, ledgers, transcripts | Scapegoat risk |
| Executioner's Bridge | Medicine, contraband, anatomical knowledge | Reputation cost |
| Cathedral Scaffolding | Heights, sanctuary, hidden passages | Grace boundary "leaking" |
| Linden Execution Ground Outside City | Vehm Court symbols and fear spread point | Secret executions |

## 5. Social Classes

### 5.1 Clergy

- Noble clergy control taxes, armies, and courts
- Lower clergy resent upper corruption
- Council of Basel intellectual sympathizers flow暗流 in monasteries

### 5.2 Nobility

- **Robber knights** self-proclaim "private war" as legal, deliver "declaration of war" before raiding caravans
- City nobles control council, eroded by guild revolution and wealth flow

### 5.3 Burghers & Guilds

- Guilds are economic organizations, also militia and political factions
- Conflict between radical manual guilds vs conservative wealthy guilds determines city policy swing

### 5.4 Jewish Community

- Key nodes for finance and medicine
- Most easily scapegoated (especially during plague/economic collapse)

### 5.5 Outcasts

Executioners, skinners, lepers, vagrants constitute "dark infrastructure":
- Knowledge of anatomy, herbs, slang, secret road networks
- Reputation and safety traded at cost

---

## 6. Law and Justice

### 6.1 Sanctuary

- Criminals fleeing to church receive 40 days refuge
- **Mist History Supplement**: When Grace falls, sanctuary may "leak," weirdness can cross boundaries

### 6.2 Feud

- Robber knights deliver declarations of war, packaging robbery as "legitimate retaliation"
- Cities can反击, but triggers连锁 retaliation and political alignment

### 6.3 Vehmgericht

- Secret judgment system handling "what public courts cannot" - powerful figures and death sentences
- Symbols: Body on tree + dagger stuck in trunk (can carve S.S.G.G.)
- **Mist History Supplement**: Some executions are not political, but "mist pollution screening"

## 7. Player Knowledge Levels

### 7.1 What Ordinary People Know

War, taxes, famine, mercenaries, guild struggles, witchcraft rumors, secret court legends

### 7.2 What Educated People Know

Council of Basel disputes, church authority cracks, underground spread of Hussite/Waldensian movements, currency devaluation mechanisms, city law vs imperial privileges

### 7.3 What Mist-Touched Know

Grace/Debt are not metaphors; some "legal executions" are screening pollution; pieces of Final Absolution exist; threshold will cross in winter 1445/46
