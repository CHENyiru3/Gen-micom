## 1. Kingdom of France (Valois)

### 1.1 Charles VII

- **Public identity**: King of France, coordinates military and diplomacy from Nancy court
- **Action style**: Calculated warfare, violence as policy tool
- **Resources**: Royal treasury and legitimacy, siege authority, marriage leverage
- **Covert goal**: Create "necessity" for 1445 standing army reform through border actions
- **Easily discovered secret**: Allows mercenaries to plunder for self-sustenance
- **Hard to discover secret**: Possesses a "captain ransom and loot ledger"

### 1.2 Louis (Dauphin, future Louis XI)

## 2. Holy Roman Empire and Habsburg

### 2.1 Emperor and Princes

- **Public goal**: Defend imperial territory, maintain legal order
- **Covert motive**: Use foreign troops to check Swiss/princes
- **Assets**: Legitimacy, titles, prince network
- **Weakness**: Central has no troops or taxes; "inviting foreign troops" damages popularity and legitimacy

### 2.2 Free Cities like Strasbourg

- **Public goal**: Autonomy, trade, city defense, extortion avoidance
- **Covert motive**: Use great power collisions to raise negotiating leverage and tax rights
- **Assets**: Guild militia, walls, counting houses, diplomatic flexibility
- **Weakness**: Internal faction splits; grain prices and rumors break order

## 3. Duchy of Burgundy (Philip the Good)

- **Public goal**: Border stability, trade protection, mediation
- **Covert motive**: Expand influence, connect northern and southern territories, buy future
- **Assets**: Funds, chancellery system, noble allies, knightly order prestige
- **Weakness**: Cannot let France eastward take the prize; cannot let empire collapse to uninvestable
- **Methods**: Loans, marriages, guild sponsorship, cultural united front

---

## 4. Church Politics

### 4.1 Council of Basel

- **Public goal**: Defend orthodoxy, end division, suppress heresy
- **Covert motive**: Use war as legitimacy test
- **Assets**: Confession and absolution, monastic networks, jurisdiction, sanctuary rights
- **Weakness**: Schism discounts authority; any weirdness can backfire on its narrative

### 4.2 Clement VIII (Core Mist History Figure)

- **Daytime history**: Abdicated 1429, died winter 1445/46
- **Mist history**: Formally submits, soul unsubmissive, prays to God "let the world witness a world without Grace"

---

## 5. Vehmgericht

### 5.1 Public Image

- Secret judgment system handling "what public courts cannot"—powerful figures and death sentences
- Symbols: Body on tree + dagger stuck in trunk (carves S.S.G.G.)

### 5.2 Mist History Supplement

- Some executions are not political, but "mist pollution screening"
- This makes it both terrifying and potentially "self-righteous"

---

## 6. "Skinners" Mercenary Consortium

- **Public goal**: Money, ransom, winter quarters, legalization
- **Covert motive**: Intimidate cities and councils into producing a "sustainable protection fee system"
