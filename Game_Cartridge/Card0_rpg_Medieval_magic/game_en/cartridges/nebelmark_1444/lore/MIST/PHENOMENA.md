## 0. Seepage Principle

Monsters first appear as "rumors/symbols/individual cases," only becoming normalized after threshold crossing. No need to start with D&D standard names:

- Divine punishment, evil omens, shadows of heresy, saints in reverse
- Daytime History explanation: Heretical witchcraft, divine punishment premonitions, plague symptoms
- Mist History truth: Actually existing imaginary creatures
