## 0. City Temperament

Nebelheim's true face isn't cathedral spires, but:

- **Mud, urine, rotting leather, soot, and beer foam** mixed together
- Prayers and curses equally common
- People believe in God, and also in ledgers and daggers
- "Justice" is at City Hall during the day, at ropes in the forest at night

## 1. City Districts

### 1.1 Outer Shantytown and Refugee Belt: The Hungry Siege

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Location** | Outside city walls |
| **Landscape** | Shacks, rotten木板 and rags; firelight like fireflies at night, smell like fog during day |
| **Faith** | "Bread Sect": some use bread crumbs for divination, claim to see how many will die this winter |
| **Black Market** | Stolen salt, diseased meat, fake medicine, fake passes, forged holy amulets |
| **Law Enforcement** | City watch occasionally "cleans up," more often comes to collect money |

**Common Conflicts**: Water fights, wood theft, grain theft, disease quarantine, scapegoat riots

---

### 1.2 Guild Street and Workshop Belt: Noise, Craft, and Calculation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sounds** | Hammering, loom clatter, slaughter sounds form an "industrial prayer" |
| **Guild Power** | Controls not just craft, but marriages, funerals, militia, voting; you must join a guild to be considered "human" |
| **Apprentice Condition** | Beatings are routine, escape leads to wanted posters |
| **Violence Form** | "Ledger violence": debt collection like hunting hounds |

**Available Locations**:
- Dye works (strong smells, easy poisoning)
- Slaughterhouse (blood and sewage)
- Blacksmith (weapons and rumors)
- Weaver towers (political secret meetings)

---

### 1.3 Market and Tavern: The Rumor Engine

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Beer is safer than water, taverns are more like public assemblies than churches |
| **Activity** | Gambling, fights, prostitution, hiring, secret deals all happen near the same table |
| **Intelligence** | "Storytellers" sell information: each story half true, half false—the more terrifying, the more valuable |
| **Scams** | Fake relics, fake indulgences, fake alchemy, fake heresy lists (for extortion) |

**Signature Scenes**:
- "Penitential Choir" sings for money at tavern doors; latter half becomes slang insulting bishops
- "The Lame Prophet" sells末日 dates, changes weekly, but always has believers

### 1.4 Jewish Quarter and Counting Houses: The Sword of Text

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Access Control** | Iron gates make it like a "night prison" |
| **Function** | City's most efficient medical and lending node |
| **Smell** | Medicine, ink, parchment |
| **Danger** | Not daggers, but: **accounts, contracts, testimony** |
| **Risk** | During plague or grain price collapse, mobs turn "complexity" into crime |

> **DM Tip**: Don't write this as a single stereotype; portray the structural contradiction of "needed yet hated."

---

### 1.5 Cathedral District and Monasteries: Light and Decay Coexist

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Landscape** | Gothic spires pierce the sky, but scaffolding and unfinished stone piles look more like wounds |
| **Power** | Controls charity, copying, judgment, shelter |
| **Dark Side** | Informant networks, indulgences and interdicts |
| **Confessional** | Can hear the dirtiest secrets |
| **Behind Altar** | Can see the cleanest lies |
| **Sanctuary Rights** | Legal buffer, also negotiating table for criminals and political prisoners |

---

### 1.6 Executioner's Bridge and City Edge: The Cursed Necessary Evil

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Executioner** | Lives far from crowds; people need him, won't meet eyes on the street his |
| **Trade** | Herbs, pain powders, abortion pills, rat poison, also buys "what others won't" |
| **Night Trade** | Bodies, bones, ransoms, fake identities, slang symbols |
| **Execution Ground Outside City** | Linden is "society's terminal," tree dagger can make you famous overnight (or permanently silent) |

---

## 2. Vice Directory

Can be directly used for encounter tables or quest locations:

| Location | Risk | Opportunity |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Cheap Brothel** | Debt bondage; protection fees to watch or mercenaries | Intelligence, clues, special relationships |
| **Gambling Den and Dogfighting Ring** | Gambling debt = violence contract | Dogfighters know many secrets |
| **Opium/Herb Houses** (Sleep Powder/Monk's Dust) | Addiction, public condemnation | Pain relief, information, spiritual adventure |
| **Sewer Workers and Cesspit Crews** | Cost of city underground map | Take you where you shouldn't go |
| **Kidnapping and Ransom Chains** | Most common prey | Rescue missions, enemy networks |

**DM Rules**: Vice places aren't "bonus levels"—provide resources and intelligence, but come with social consequences (Rumor/Heat, credit, enemies).

---

## 3. Slang and Symbol Systems

### 3.1 Three Principles of Rotwelsch

- Words short, coarse, with animal metaphors ("wolf's mouth = tax collector," "white hand = broke," "black bread = dirty work")
- Each group has its own "code phrases"
- Slang is class weapon: those who don't understand pay more

### 3.2 Doorframe Carving: Two Systems

| System | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Vagrant Marks** | This place gives alms/has vicious dogs/police are fierce/can stay overnight | Daytime History |
| **Mist Marks** | Looks like vagrant carving but finer, points to "crack points" or "threshold doors" | Mist History |

## 4. Street Narrative Engines

These aren't background decor, they're engines for every session:

| # | Engine | Trigger | Possible Consequences |
|---|--------|---------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Bread Queue Conflict** | Grain price rises/supply cut | Grain grab, rumors, violence, bribery |
| 2 | **Watch Extortion** | Any street action | Refuse → body search/frame-up |
| 3 | **Mercenary Night Patrol** | Going out at night | "Protection fee" extortion, violence |
| 4 | **Workshop Accident** | Exploring guild district | Fire/chemical dye poisoning/collapse; saving people affects Grace/Debt |
| 5 | **Scapegoat Moment** | After weirdness/plague | Crowd wants "cause," weakest first accused |
| 6 | **Confessional Trade** | Church area | Secret for absolution, absolution for money, money for silence |
| 7 | **Black Market Relics** | Exploring black market | Hard to tell real from fake; wrong purchase raises Heat; right purchase brings pursuit |
