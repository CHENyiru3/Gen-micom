# .DM_PLANNER.md — DM Planning and Suspense Engine (Hidden File, Strictly Prohibit Leaking to Players)

> **Purpose**: Specifically used for DM's behind-the-scenes thinking and planning: subsequent plot direction, twists, clue distribution rhythm, behind-the-scenes faction actions.
> **Strict Rules**: This file's content must not be directly paraphrased or referenced in player-visible output; can only be gradually manifested through "in-game visible clues/events" and written to `sessions/`.

## 0) This File Usage Protocol (Must Obey)

1. **No Direct Spoilers**: Don't output this file content directly in turn narrative (including names, truths, behind-the-scenes motives, twists).
2. **Use Clues to Manifest**: Each behind-the-scenes setting must correspond to "deliverable clue form" (physical evidence/testimony/omen/ledger/map change).
3. **Event Source Priority**: All occurred content takes `sessions/` as source; this file is only "plan", dynamically adjusted with player behavior.
4. **Maintain After Each Session**: At session end update:
   - Add/advance: suspense and timers
   - Plan changes: adjust based on player choices
   - Clue inventory: released/pending/retired
5. **Length Control**: Keep short; prioritize listing; avoid long prose.
