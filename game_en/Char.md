# RHINE_CRISIS_1444.md — 1444 Rhine Crisis: Daylight History Character Network and Mist History Projection
Version: v1.0 (RAG / TTRPG Backend Use)
Time Anchor: 1444 (Fracture Period Start) → 1445/46 (Threshold Crossing)
Geographic Core: Metz — Lorraine — Alsace — Upper Rhine — Old Swiss Confederation Border
Setting Authority: **Daylight history characters and relations use this file as canon**; Mist History "seeps through" without rewriting daylight history factual outcomes.

---

## 0) Overview: An "Exported" Violence and a Torn Map
The 1444 Treaty of Tours brought not peace but the release of unemployed violence: massive "Armagnacs / Écorcheurs" (Armagnacs / Flayers) eastward into Lorraine — Alsace — Swiss Border.
This is not单纯 robbers tide, but an accelerant for power restructuring:

- **France** throws "domestic失控 knives" at imperial border,，顺便为安茹 allies seize interests.
- **Empire** center无力, defenses临时拼接 by princes and cities,随时可能内斗.
- **Burgundy**不急于出兵, but lets situations "mature", then uses contracts, loans and marriages to take over future.
- **Church politics** (Basel Council and antipope) makes legitimacy更加脆弱: today you are "just punishment of justice", tomorrow may be "evidence of heresy".

> Mist History Authority: 1444 is the Fracture Period — the uncanny first appears as rumors and individual cases; after 1445/46 threshold crossing, the uncanny begins to be "repeatable, traceable, tradable".

## 1) War Zones and Stages (Daylight History Verifiable Conflict Surfaces)
### 1.1 Metz Siege
- Trigger: Duke René of Anjou of Lorraine vs. Metz Republic; King Charles VII of France directly intervenes.
- Significance: Royal power "nationalizes" border affairs, upgrades feudal disputes into royal policy.

### 1.2 Alsace and Upper Rhine Plunder and Defense
- "Flayers" extort, arson, kidnap countryside and small cities; city militia and guild towers become defensive backbone.
- Free cities like Strasbourg self-help through diplomacy + militia in emperor's absence.

### 1.3 Old Swiss Confederation Border and St. Jakob Battle
- Swiss infantry performs strongly, forcing French heir Louis to make pragmatic shift: from "retaliation" to "alliance/balancing".

### 1.4 Imperial Princes' Temporary Alliance
- Elector Palatine Ludwig IV takes on "Imperial Captain" style front-line organization; Habsburgs (Frederick III, Sigismund) bear political cost of inviting foreign troops.

### 1.5 Burgundian Standing By
- Through agents and clauses infiltrates Lorraine, Alsace; paves way for future "Middle Kingdom".

### 1.6 Basel Council and End of Church Schism
- Antipope Felix V still has support, but political foundation being eroded by warfare and diplomatic shifts.

## 2) Power Structure: Six Factions (Daylight History)

### 2.1 Kingdom of France (Valois)
- Public Goals: Stabilize domestic, suppress mercenaries, support Lorraine allies, expand Rhine influence.
- Hidden Motives: Institutionalize "war financing and violence outsourcing", pave way for standing army reform.
- Assets: Royal legitimacy, army scale, diplomatic marriage leverage.
- Weaknesses: Mercenary discipline collapse, border reputation collapse, loot distribution contradictions.

### 2.2 "Flayer" Mercenary Consortium (Captains' Alliance)
- Public Goals: Money, ransom, winter camp supplies, legalization.
- Hidden Motives: Through intimidating cities and parliaments, force out "sustainable protection fee system".
- Assets: Mobile violence, kidnapping network, loot cash flow.
- Weaknesses: Mutual suspicion internally; implodes quickly once ransom channels lost.

### 2.3 Holy Roman Empire and Habsburg
- Public Goals: Defend imperial territory, maintain legal order.
- Hidden Motives: Use foreign troops to restrain Swiss/princes (and redistribute for own interests).
- Assets: Legalities, titles, prince network.
- Weaknesses: Center has no troops or taxes; "inviting foreign troops" brings legitimacy damage.

### 2.4 Rhine Free Cities (Strasbourg/Metz Representatives)
- Public Goals: Autonomy, trade, city defense, freedom from extortion.
- Hidden Motives: Use great power collision to raise own negotiating price and tax rights.
- Assets: Guild militia, walls, accounting rooms, diplomatic flexibility.

- Hidden Motives: Expand influence, connect northern and southern territories, buy future.
- Assets: Funds, chancellor system, noble allies, knight order reputation.
- Weaknesses: Can't let France advance east "take the chips"; can't let empire collapse to uninvestable.

### 2.6 Church Politics: Rome vs. Basel Council
- Public Goals: Defend orthodoxy, end schism, constrain heresy.
- Hidden Motives: Use war as legitimacy touchstone: who can "absolve/excommunicate/define sin" can rule.
- Assets: Confession and absolution, monastery networks, jurisdiction, sanctuary rights.
- Weaknesses: Schism discounts authority; any uncanny can backfire on its narrative.

## 5) Mist History Character Settings ("Projection Layer" on Daylight History Character Network)

> Rule: Mist History characters must not change Daylight History event outcomes, can only change **risk, temptation, evidence chain, rumors, and cost**.
> Each Mist History NPC gives: Appearance / Religious or Heretical Colors / Connection to Daylight History Characters / Triggerable Consequences.

### 5.1 The "Mist Court Clerk" — Agent of "Contracts as Curse"

* Appearance: Beside Metz negotiating tables, ransom payments, treaty oaths; appears like a notary/clerk, face obscured by thin mist.
* Colors: Turns law into divine punishment tool; its text can "self-complete clauses" at night.
* Connection: Often appears with Rolin's delegations or mercenary captains' threat letters (whoever first abuses contracts is more likely to attract it).
* Consequences: Signer's **Debt+1** or **Heat+1**; short-term gains, long-term条款 backlash (debts, oaths, passage rights "locked").

### 5.2 The "Seven Candle Child" — Tempter of St. Jakob Battlefield

* Appearance: Twelve nights, thick fog, post-battle cemeteries; like a child's shadow with seven candle flames atop head.
* Colors: Religious allegorical trial — shows you "the victory you most desire."
* Connection: Most easily haunts Dauphin Louis's camp, Swiss martyr legends, Piccolomini's recorded scenes.
* Consequences: Following guidance grants key intelligence or shortcuts, but at cost (sacrifice innocents/break oaths/trade for political stain).

### 5.3 The "Salt Ash Monk" — Silent Purification of Siege and Plague

* Appearance: Shantytowns, plague pits, siege night patrols; cloaked, leaves salt-ash footprints.
* Colors: Like angel like death; its "purification" asks not good or evil, only order.
* Connection: Bishop Conrad's diocese, monastery relief, Charles VII's camp尸堆.
* Consequences: Can suppress undead and dream plague, but may cause **Grace-1** (grace "replaced by order") or trigger "scapegoat" violence.

### 5.4 The "Penitence Bird" — Wind Gauge of Lies

* Appearance: Confessional chambers, parliamentary halls, ransom exchange points; gray-white bird with cross-like brand on chest.
* Colors: Divine punishment's edge signal; not judge, but "recall grace prompt sound."
* Connection: Nicole Louve's negotiations, Schalck's mobilization speeches, captains' oaths.
* Consequences: If someone lies in divine name present, it goes silent and falls to ash — directly drives Rumor diffusion.

### 5.5 The "Stigmata Beggar" — Trading "Names and Oaths" for Reality

* Appearance: Market squares, tavern doorways, city gate tax posts; hands and feet bleeding but clothes abnormally clean.
* Colors: Saint/devil boundary blurred; in heretical mouths "true revelation", in monastery mouths "most dangerous counterfeit."
* Connection: Favors targeting cash-strapped René, indebted captains, grain price manipulators (Peter Schott).
* Consequences: Those giving name/oath will be "remembered": at key future moments **Heat+1** or "summoned as witness."

### 5.6 The "Fog Mark Shepherd" — "Third Eye" in Waldensian Network

* Appearance: Itinerant merchants, healers, manuscript sellers; knows how to identify "doorway fog marks."
* Colors: Heretical redemptionism: the uncanny不是末日, but redemption opportunity.
* Connection: Reiser and Anna's underground network; can lead players to fracture points or safe houses.
* Consequences: Provides secret road network through blockades, but drags players into heresy trial gravity (Heat rises faster).

### 5.7 The "Linden Rope Maker" — Non-Human Execution of Fehm Court

* Appearance: Execution ground linden trees, night forest trials; never appears during day.
* Colors: Embodiment of night law; its dagger scars change with sin debt.
* Connection: Robber knight Rechberg, treasonous Count Lützelstein, city noble internal strife.
* Consequences: It doesn't pursue "evil", pursues "disorder": when Violence/ScapegoatRisk rises, it "makes decisions for the city."

---

## 6) Adventure Hooks (Strongly Bound to Character Network)

1. **"The Ransom Ledger"**: Culant's spy class loses ledger page, records captain ransoms and certain city noble's share of loot. Whoever gets it can strangle a political line.

2. **"The Second Page of Ensisheim Treaty"**: Treaty has one page with clauses "supplemented by Mist Court Clerk," only visible under candlelight. Dauphin Louis wants to destroy, Rolin wants to acquire, Piccolomini wants to record.

3. **"The Cleansing Within Metz"**: Norroy prepared to sacrifice one neighborhood for regime stability; Nicole Louve tries diplomacy to save people. Player intervention changes city internal factions and Heat.

4. **"The Secret Path of Vosges"**: Count Lützelstein holds mountain path; Waldensians hold another. Both lead to same fracture point, different costs.

5. **"The Salt Ash Monk's Purification"**: Shantytown outbreak of dream plague, monasteries want lockdown and burn, guilds want labor, mercenaries want money. Salt Ash Monk appears, offers "quiet solution," but sacrifices Grace.

6. **"Felix V's Blank Absolution"**: Antipope's blank documents flow into black market, can clothe any atrocity in sacred guise. Who's buying? Who's selling?

7. **"Rechberg's Declaration of War"**: Robber knight delivers declaration according to protocol, city must respond according to protocol or lose legal standing. Mist Court Clerk present, clauses become curses.
