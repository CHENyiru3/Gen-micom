## 0. Quick Reference Anchors

- **Mist Frontier (Nebelmark)**: Fictional border on left bank of upper Rhine
- **Nebelheim (Nebelheim)**: Free Imperial City, main stage
- **Era**: 1444 (Fracture Period) → 1445/46 (Threshold Crossing)
- **System**: D&D 5e (realistic medieval grounding)

## 1. Design Pillars

1. **Daylight History not overturned**: Politics, war, economy, class, law follow real-world logic
2. **Fantasy appears as "seepage"**: First rumors and individual cases, then repeatable uncanny
3. **Divine punishment and redemption coexist**: The supernatural is not a reward, but a trial
4. **Consequence-driven**: Every success/failure changes world state

---

## 2. Era Background (1444)

### 2.1 European Landscape

This is the cusp of "Autumn of Middle Ages" and "Spring of Renaissance":

- **Church**: Great Schism nominally healed, but authority fragile. Basel Council (1431-1449) fights papal authority
- **France**: Hundred Years War near end (officially 1453), royal power recovers, projects power eastward
- **Holy Roman Empire**: Nominally grand, power decentralized. Emperor far in hereditary territories, border city-states left to fend for themselves
- **Burgundy**: Rich, refined, orderly, ambitious, more dangerous to border cities with seduction than army

### 2.2 Technology and Society

- Gunpowder and phalanxes weaken knight military monopoly
- Currency and taxation冲击 lord rent
- Guilds and burgher class rise, social mobility accelerates
- Violence and opportunity coexist

## 3. Geography: Mist Frontier

### 3.1 Key Terrain

| Region | Features |
|--------|----------|
| **Rhine Mainline** | Trade and army spine, refugee corridor |
| **Black Pine Forest and Fog Marsh** | Heaviest mist area, legend says "Wild Hunt" once passed through |
| **Hills Vineyard Zone** | Wealthiest guild and Burgundy merchant influence |
| **Mines and Quarries** | Economic lifeline, earliest location of "underground anomalies" |

### 3.2 Transportation and Nodes

- **Market routes**: Determine city survival, blockade means famine is first card
- **Border checkpoints and bridge taxes**: Guilds and nobles, bishoprics compete for tax rights
- **Secret paths**: "Underground road network" used by heretics, smugglers, vagrants

---

## 4. Nebelheim

### 4.1 City Structure (Outside to Inside)

1. **Outer earthworks and refugee shantytowns**: Incubator of hunger, disease, rumors
2. **Middle residential districts and guild towers**: Workshops, taverns, markets, political factions ferment
3. **Old Town and Cathedral District**: Power stage for nobles and high clergy

### 4.2 Key Locations

| Location | Function | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Town Hall and Town Cellar | Agreements, bribes, conspiracies, faction deals | Faction conflict |
| Jewish Lane | Prescriptions, ledgers, manuscripts | Scapegoat risk |
| Executioner's Bridge | Medicine, contraband, anatomical knowledge | Reputation cost |
| Cathedral Scaffolding | Heights, sanctuary, hidden passages | Grace boundary "leaking" |
| Outside City Linden Execution Ground | Fehm Court symbols and fear spread point | Secret executions |

## 5. Social Classes

### 5.1 Clergy

- Noble clergy control taxation, military, judgment
- Lower clergy resent upper corruption
- Council派 intellectuals and reform sympathizers暗流涌动 in monasteries

### 5.2 Nobility

- **Robber knights** self-proclaim "private war" as legal, deliver "declaration of war" then plunder caravans
- City nobles control parliament, eroded by guild revolution and wealth flow

### 5.3 Burghers & Guilds

- Guilds are economic organizations, also militia and political factions
- Conflict between radical physical labor guilds vs conservative wealthy guilds determines city policy swings

### 5.4 Jewish Community

- Key nodes for finance and medicine
- Most easily made scapegoat (especially during plague/economic collapse)

### 5.5 Outcasts

Executioners, flayers, lepers, vagrants form "dark infrastructure":
- Master anatomy, herbs, slang, secret road networks
- Pay with reputation and safety

## 6. Law and Justice

### 6.1 Sanctuary

- Criminals fleeing to church receive 40 days sanctuary
- **Mist History Supplement**: When Grace drops, sanctuary may "leak", uncanny can cross boundary

### 6.2 Private War (Feud)

- Robber knights deliver declaration of war, package robbery as "legal revenge"
- Cities can counter, but trigger连锁 revenge and political alignment

### 6.3 Fehm Court (Vehmgericht)

- Secret trial system, handles "what public courts can't handle" — dignitaries and death sentences
- Symbols: Body in tree + dagger stuck in tree (can carve S.S.G.G.)
- **Mist History Supplement**: Some executions are not political, but "Mist pollution screening"
