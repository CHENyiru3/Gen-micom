## 0. Seepage Principle

Monsters first appear as "rumors/symbols/individual cases", become more normalized after threshold crossing. No need to start with D&D standard names:

- Divine punishment, omens, heretical shadows, saints' opposites
- Daylight History explanation: Heretical witchcraft, divine punishment omens, plague symptoms
- Mist History truth: Actually existing strange creatures
