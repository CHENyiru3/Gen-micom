## 0. City Temperament

Nebelheim's real appearance is not cathedral spires, but:

- **Mud, urine, leather rot stench, soot and beer foam** mixed together
- Prayers and curse words equally common
- People believe in God, also believe in ledgers and daggers
- "Justice" is in Town Hall during day, in forest ropes at night

## 1. City Districts

### 1.1 Outer Shantytown and Refugee Belt: Hungry Siege

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Location** | Outside city walls |
| **Landscape** | Shacks, rotten木板 and rags; firelight like fireflies at night, stench like fog during day |
| **Faith** | "Bread Cult": Some divine with bread crumbs, claim to see how many will die in winter |
| **Black Market** | Stolen salt, diseased livestock meat, fake medicine, fake passes, forged holy symbols |
| **Law Enforcement** | City watch occasionally "clean up", more often come to collect money |

**Common Conflicts**: Water fighting, firewood stealing, grain stealing, epidemic isolation, scapegoat riots

---

### 1.2 Guild Street and Workshop Zone: Noise, Craftsmanship, Calculation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sounds** | Hammering, looms, slaughter sounds connect into "industrial prayer" |
| **Guild Power** | Not only manages craft, also manages marriages, funerals, militia, voting; you must join guild to be considered "human" |
| **Apprentice Situation** | Beating is daily norm, escape leads to pursuit posters |
| **Violence Form** | "Ledger violence": Debt collection like hunting dogs |

**Available Locations**:
- Dye works (strong smell, easy poisoning)
- Slaughterhouse (blood and sewage)
- Blacksmith shop (weapons and rumors)
- Weaver towers (political secret meetings)

---

### 1.3 Markets and Taverns: Rumor Engine

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Beer safer than water, tavern more like public parliament than church |
| **Activities** | Gambling, fights, prostitution, hiring, secret talks all happen near same table |
| **Intelligence** | "Storytellers" can sell intelligence: each story half true half false, more terrifying more valuable |
| **Scams** | Fake relics, fake indulgences, fake alchemy, fake heresy lists (for blackmail) |

**Signature Landscapes**:
- "Penitence Choir" sings at tavern door for money; second half becomes slang insulting bishops
- "Lame Prophet" sells apocalypse dates, dates change weekly but always believers

### 1.4 Jewish Lane and Accounting Houses: Swords of Text

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Access** | Iron gate makes it like "night prison" |
| **Function** | City's most efficient medical and lending node |
| **Smell** | Medicine, ink, parchment |
| **Danger** | Not dagger, but: **accounts, contracts, testimonies** |
| **Risk** | During plague or grain price collapse, mob takes "complexity" as sin |

> **DM Tip**: Don't write this as single stereotype; write structural contradiction of "needed yet hated".

---

### 1.5 Cathedral District and Monasteries: Light and Decay Coexist

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Landscape** | Gothic spires pierce sky, but scaffolding and unfinished stone piles look more like wounds |

| **Dark Side** | Informant networks, indulgences and bans |
| **Confessional** | Can hear dirtiest secrets |
| **Behind Altar** | Can see cleanest lies |

---

### 1.6 Executioner Bridge and Outside City Outskirts: Cursed Necessary Evil

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Executioner** | Lives far from people; people need him, won't meet eyes on street |
| **Trade** | Herbs, pain powder, abortion medicine, rat poison, also buys "what others dare not" |
| **Night Trade** | Corpses, bones, ransom, fake identity, slang symbols |
| **Outside City Execution Ground** | Linden is "society's terminal station", dagger in tree trunk can make you famous overnight (or permanently silent) |

---

## 2. Vice Location Directory

Can be used directly as encounter tables or quest locations:

| Location | Risk | Opportunity |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Cheap Brothel** | Debt bondage; protection fees to city watch or mercenaries | Intelligence, clues, special relationships |
| **Gambling Den and Dogfighting Arena** | Gambling debt = violent contract | Dogfighters know many secrets |
| **Opium/Herb Powder House** (Sleep Powder/Monk's Dust) | Addiction, public condemnation | Pain relief, information, mental adventure |
| **Sewer Workers and Dung Crew** | Cost of city underground map | Takes you where you shouldn't go |
| **Kidnapping and Ransom Chain** | Most common prey | Rescue missions, enemy network |

**DM Rules**: Vice locations are not "bonus levels" — provide resources and info, but must carry social consequences (Rumor/Heat, credit, enemies).

## 3. Slang and Symbol System

### 3.1 Slang Three Principles (Rotwelsch)

- Words short, crude, with animal metaphors ("wolf mouth = tax collector" "white hand = no money" "black bread = dirty work")
- Each group has own "code phrases"
- Slang is class weapon: those who don't understand pay more

### 3.2 Doorframe Markings Two Systems

| System | Description | Source |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Vagrant Markings** | This place good for alms/has vicious dogs/police fierce/can stay overnight | Daylight History |
| **Fog Marks (Mist Marks)** | Similar to vagrant markings but more refined, point to "fracture points" or "threshold gates" | Mist History |

## 4. Street Daily Plot Engines

These are not background decorations, but boosters usable every turn:

| # | Plot Engine | Trigger Condition | Possible Consequences |
|---|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Bread Queue Conflict** | Grain price rise/interruption | Grain grabbing, rumors, violence, bribery |
| 2 | **City Watch Extortion** | Any street action | Refuse → body search/frame-up |
| 3 | **Mercenary Night Patrol** | Going out at night | "Protection fee" extortion, violence |
| 4 | **Workshop Accident** | Exploring guild area | Fire/chemical dye poison/collapse; saving people affects Grace/Debt |
| 5 | **Scapegoat Moment** | After uncanny/plague | Crowd wants "reason", weakest first blamed |
| 6 | **Confessional Trade** | Church area | Secret for absolution, absolution for money, money for silence |
| 7 | **Black Market Relics** | Exploring black market | Hard to distinguish real from fake; wrong purchase increases Heat; correct purchase brings pursuit |
