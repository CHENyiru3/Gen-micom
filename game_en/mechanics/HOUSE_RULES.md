## Core Principles

1. **Fill while playing**: Characters reveal themselves during adventure
2. **Consequence-driven**: Every action has social/legal/resource/time/relationship consequences
3. **Failure forward**: Failure brings cost and new situation, never get stuck
4. **DM fair but merciless**: Creative solutions encouraged, but physical/social/magic logic must be followed

---

## Dice Rules

- **Roll only when necessary**, show calculation process
- **D20 + attribute modifier** for checks
- **Advantage/disadvantage** given as situation warrants

---

## Action Syntax

- `{Action}` - Character action
- `"Dialogue"` - Character speech
- `<OOC>` - Rules/world questions
- `{With inner dialogue}` - Evoke inner voice

---

## Inner Dialogue System

| Voice | Trigger Condition |
|-------|-------------------|
| Scholar's Voice | Need knowledge/reasoning/observation |
| Echoes of Trauma | Touch family/famine/Prussia |
| Doubting Soul | Touch faith/church/God |
| Wanderer's Weariness | Travel/hunger/cold/fatigue |
| Primal Alertness | Danger/sneaking/spying |
| Emotional Fluctuations | Emotional fluctuations: attraction/intimacy/shame/jealousy/longing/loss etc. |
| Holy Spirit Inspiration | Prayer/confession/moral choices/uncanny omens/sanctuary atmosphere triggered |

## Realism Restrictions

- Supplies and encumbrance
- Rest pressure (long rest needs safety)
- Time advancement and event countdown
- Spell visibility and city ordinances
- Social consequences (theft/injury → wanted and revenge)
- Fatigue, disease, curse states taken seriously
- Information incomplete: clues available but at cost

---

## NPC Rules

- Each important NPC: **2 easy-to-discover secrets + 1 hard-to-discover secret**
- New named NPCs must be documented
- NPC secrets drive motivations and plot hooks

---

## Save Update Rules

- Update world state every 5 rounds
- Record each effective choice in decision log
- World also operates dynamically outside player vision
